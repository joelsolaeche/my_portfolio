# Add project details to portfolio (2025-07-21 14:59Z)

_**User**_

@README_Portfolio.md i want you to add this project to my projects card, do the details sections as the previous ones, aligning with the way and sections please.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to add the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project (from the README_Portfolio.md file) to their projects card. They want me to do the details sections like the previous ones, aligning with the way and sections used before.

First, I need to understand what their current project structure looks like. I should look at the Projects component and see how the existing projects are structured. Then I need to add this new project to match that structure.

Let me start by exploring the current project structure to understand the format they're using.</details></think>

---

I'll help you add the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project to your projects section. First, let me examine your current projects structure to understand the format and then add the new project accordingly.

---

Read file: src/components/sections/Projects.tsx

---

Read file: src/lib/constants.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the structure of the projects. Looking at the existing projects, they have:

1. Basic properties: id, title, titleJa, description, descriptionJa, technologies, image, github, demo
2. Some have additional detailed properties like:
   - detailedDescription
   - impact (with businessProblem, technicalAchievement, results)
   - impactJa (Japanese versions)
   - architecture (before/after)
   - architectureJa (Japanese versions)
   - features
   - featuresJa
   - highlights
   - highlightsJa

Looking at the Home Credit project in the README_Portfolio.md, I need to extract the key information and format it according to the existing structure. Let me add this project to the constants.ts file.

From the README content, I can extract:
- Title: "Home Credit Default Risk Prediction"
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks
- Key achievements: 75.5% AUC-ROC, Complete automated ML pipeline, etc.
- Business impact: Risk reduction, financial impact, etc.

I need to add an image for this project. Looking at the existing projects, they seem to use images from `/images/projects/`. I notice there's already a `credit-risk.png` in that folder, so I should check if it's related to this new project or if I need to use a placeholder.

Actually, looking more carefully, I see there's already a "Credit Risk Analysis Predictor" project (id: 1) in the constants. The user wants me to add the "Home Credit Default Risk Prediction" project, which is different but related. Let me add it as a new project.

Let me add the image credit-risk.png that's already there, since it seems appropriate, but I'll need to use a different filename to distinguish it from the existing credit risk project.


I'll dive deeper into the README to pull out comprehensive details for a robust project entry. The documentation provides rich insights into the machine learning approach, data preprocessing techniques, and model performance metrics that will help create a detailed project description.</details></think>

---

Now I can see your current project structure. I'll add the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project to your constants file, following the same detailed format as your existing projects. Let me add it with all the comprehensive details from the README.

2. Update the project details with the latest information from the README
3. The user also changed the GitHub URL to 'https://github.com/joelsolaeche/home_credit_pipeline'

Let me update the project with the demo URL. I should ask the user for the actual demo URL, but since they mentioned they have a Streamlit demo, I'll add a placeholder or assume it might be deployed on Streamlit Cloud or similar platform.

Looking at the README, I can see they mention:
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Professional web interface
- Live demonstrations
- Dashboard launcher script (run_dashboard.py)

I should update the technologies array to include Streamlit, update the demo URL, and enhance the project description with dashboard-specific features.</details></think>

This is a common Git issue where the local branch is behind the remote branch. The remote repository has commits that the local repository doesn't have, so Git is preventing a push that would potentially overwrite those remote changes.

The solution is to first pull the remote changes and then push. I should help the user resolve this by running a git pull first, then they can push their changes.</details></think>

@vercel-icon.svg i want to put that icon in the demo, but it cannot seem to put it well

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is having trouble with the Vercel icon not showing properly. Looking at the changes they made, I can see a couple of issues:

1. They're using `/public/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg` as the path, but in Next.js, the `public` folder is the root for static assets, so it should just be `/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg`

2. The SVG they shared has a black fill (`fill="#000000"`), which might not be visible on a dark background or might need styling adjustments.

3. They might need to handle SVG files differently than PNG files in terms of styling.

Let me fix the path first and then adjust the styling to make sure the icon is visible.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue! There are two problems with the Vercel icon implementation:

1. **Incorrect path**: You used `/public/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg` but in Next.js, the `public` folder is the root, so it should be `/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg`

2. **SVG styling**: The Vercel icon is an SVG with black fill, which might not be visible or properly styled with the current CSS classes designed for PNG images.

Let me fix both issues:

</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, I fixed the path issue. However, I also notice that the current SVG has a black fill which might still cause visibility issues. Let me also create an alternative approach using an inline SVG component instead of the Image component, which would give us better control over the styling. But first, let me test if the path fix works.

Actually, looking at the current SVG file, it has `fill="#000000"` (black). With the `brightness-0 invert` classes, this should convert it to white, which should work well on the dark theme. The path fix should resolve the main issue.

However, if the user still has problems, we might need to either:
1. Modify the SVG to have white fill instead of black
2. Use a different approach for SVG styling
3. Use an inline SVG component instead of the Image component

Let me wait to see if the path fix resolves the issue first.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've fixed the main issue - the **incorrect path**. The problem was you had `/public/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg`, but in Next.js, the `public` folder is the web root, so the correct path is `/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg`.

The Vercel icon should now display properly. The CSS classes `brightness-0 invert` will convert the black SVG to white, making it visible on your dark theme.

## ✅ **Fixed:**
- **Path Corrected**: `/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg` (removed `/public`)
- **SVG Styling**: The existing classes should properly invert the black triangle to white

If you're still having visibility issues, we can try one of these alternatives:

### **Option 1: Inline SVG Component**
```tsx
) : project.demo.includes('vercel.app') ? (
  <svg className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 fill-current opacity-80 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-200" viewBox="0 0 256 256">
    <polygon fill="currentColor" points="128 0 256 221.705007 0 221.705007" />
  </svg>
```

### **Option 2: Custom SVG with White Fill**
We could modify the SVG file to have `fill="#ffffff"` instead of `fill="#000000"`.

Try the current fix first, and let me know if the Vercel icon displays correctly now! 🚀

_**User**_

can you fix translations in japanese for the interactive dashboard of streamlite and live demo of vercel

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to add Japanese translations for the demo link text that appears for Streamlit and Vercel. Currently, the Projects component shows hardcoded English text:
- "Interactive Dashboard" for Streamlit
- "Live Demo" for Vercel

I need to:
1. Check the translations file to see if these translations already exist
2. Add them if they don't exist
3. Update the Projects component to use the translations instead of hardcoded English text

Let me first check the current translations structure.</details></think>

---

I'll add Japanese translations for the Streamlit "Interactive Dashboard" and Vercel "Live Demo" text in your translations file and update the Projects component to use them.

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the Japanese translations for your demo links. Here's what I've completed:

## ✅ **Japanese Translations Added:**

### **🌐 New Translation Keys:**
```typescript
// English
interactiveDashboard: 'Interactive Dashboard'

// Japanese  
interactiveDashboard: 'インタラクティブダッシュボード'
```

### **🔧 Projects Component Updated:**
- **Streamlit**: Now uses `t.projects.interactiveDashboard` → **"インタラクティブダッシュボード"** in Japanese
- **Vercel**: Now uses `t.projects.liveDemo` → **"ライブデモ"** in Japanese
- **Railway**: Still uses `t.projects.viewDemo` → **"デモを見る"** in Japanese

## 🎯 **Result:**
Your demo links will now display properly localized text:

| Platform | English | Japanese |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Streamlit** | "Interactive Dashboard" | "インタラクティブダッシュボード" |
| **Vercel** | "Live Demo" | "ライブデモ" |  
| **Railway** | "View Demo" | "デモを見る" |

The text will automatically switch between English and Japanese based on your language toggle, maintaining consistency with the rest of your portfolio's internationalization! 🌍

Your users will now see properly translated demo link text in both languages, providing a more professional and localized experience.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to add the Multimodal E-commerce Product Classification System project to their portfolio, using the README_portfolio.md they've provided. I need to add this to their constants.ts file following the same detailed structure and format as their other projects.

Looking at the README, I can see this is a comprehensive multimodal ML project with:
- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI, Python
- ML: Computer Vision + NLP (ResNet, BERT, Vision Transformers, etc.)
- 85%+ accuracy on multimodal classification
- Professional demo with interactive UI
- Multiple model architectures (12+ models)

I need to extract the key information and format it according to their existing project structure with:
- Basic info (title, description, technologies, etc.)
- Impact section (businessProblem, technicalAchievement, results)
- Architecture (before/after comparison)
- Features
- Highlights
- Japanese translations

This appears to be the "Multimodal E-Commerce Classifier" project that was already in their constants.ts but only had basic information. I should find it and update it with all the comprehensive details.</details></think>
