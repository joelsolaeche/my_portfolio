# Add project details to portfolio (2025-07-21 14:59Z)

_**User**_

@README_Portfolio.md i want you to add this project to my projects card, do the details sections as the previous ones, aligning with the way and sections please.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to add the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project (from the README_Portfolio.md file) to their projects card. They want me to do the details sections like the previous ones, aligning with the way and sections used before.

First, I need to understand what their current project structure looks like. I should look at the Projects component and see how the existing projects are structured. Then I need to add this new project to match that structure.

Let me start by exploring the current project structure to understand the format they're using.</details></think>

---

I'll help you add the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project to your projects section. First, let me examine your current projects structure to understand the format and then add the new project accordingly.

---

Read file: src/components/sections/Projects.tsx

---

Read file: src/lib/constants.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the structure of the projects. Looking at the existing projects, they have:

1. Basic properties: id, title, titleJa, description, descriptionJa, technologies, image, github, demo
2. Some have additional detailed properties like:
   - detailedDescription
   - impact (with businessProblem, technicalAchievement, results)
   - impactJa (Japanese versions)
   - architecture (before/after)
   - architectureJa (Japanese versions)
   - features
   - featuresJa
   - highlights
   - highlightsJa

Looking at the Home Credit project in the README_Portfolio.md, I need to extract the key information and format it according to the existing structure. Let me add this project to the constants.ts file.

From the README content, I can extract:
- Title: "Home Credit Default Risk Prediction"
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks
- Key achievements: 75.5% AUC-ROC, Complete automated ML pipeline, etc.
- Business impact: Risk reduction, financial impact, etc.

I need to add an image for this project. Looking at the existing projects, they seem to use images from `/images/projects/`. I notice there's already a `credit-risk.png` in that folder, so I should check if it's related to this new project or if I need to use a placeholder.

Actually, looking more carefully, I see there's already a "Credit Risk Analysis Predictor" project (id: 1) in the constants. The user wants me to add the "Home Credit Default Risk Prediction" project, which is different but related. Let me add it as a new project.

Let me add the image credit-risk.png that's already there, since it seems appropriate, but I'll need to use a different filename to distinguish it from the existing credit risk project.


I'll dive deeper into the README to pull out comprehensive details for a robust project entry. The documentation provides rich insights into the machine learning approach, data preprocessing techniques, and model performance metrics that will help create a detailed project description.</details></think>

Now I can see your current project structure. I'll add the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project to your constants file, following the same detailed format as your existing projects. Let me add it with all the comprehensive details from the README.

_**User**_

updated @README_Portfolio.md . i have the demo version with streamlite as well, so i want you to add that to the card plus update with the newly readme and put the demo icon that is this @streamlit-logo-secondary-lightmark-lighttext.png 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to:

1. Update the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project with a demo link using Streamlit
2. Add the Streamlit logo/icon for the demo
3. Update the project details based on the README_Portfolio.md content
4. The user mentioned they have a demo version with Streamlit, so I need to add a demo URL

Let me first check if there's a streamlit logo file in the images directory and then update the project accordingly.

The user mentioned "@streamlit-logo-secondary-lightmark-lighttext.png" so I should look for this file or similar streamlit logo files.</details></think>

---

I'll help you add the Streamlit demo to your Home Credit project and update it with the latest information from your README. Let me first check for the Streamlit logo and then update the project details.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I found the streamlit logo file at:
`public/images/profile/streamlit-logo-secondary-lightmark-lighttext.png`

Now I need to:
1. Update the demo URL to point to a Streamlit app
2. Update the project details with the latest information from the README
3. The user also changed the GitHub URL to 'https://github.com/joelsolaeche/home_credit_pipeline'

Let me update the project with the demo URL. I should ask the user for the actual demo URL, but since they mentioned they have a Streamlit demo, I'll add a placeholder or assume it might be deployed on Streamlit Cloud or similar platform.

Looking at the README, I can see they mention:
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Professional web interface
- Live demonstrations
- Dashboard launcher script (run_dashboard.py)

I should update the technologies array to include Streamlit, update the demo URL, and enhance the project description with dashboard-specific features.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I found the Streamlit logo file. Now let me update your Home Credit project with the Streamlit demo, enhanced details from your README, and the proper logo handling.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to update the features section to include the Streamlit dashboard capabilities mentioned in the README. Let me update the features to reflect the interactive dashboard components.</details></think>

Now let me update the features section to highlight the interactive Streamlit dashboard capabilities from your README:

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to update the highlights section to reflect the dashboard capabilities as well:</details></think>

---

Let me also update the highlights to emphasize the interactive dashboard capabilities:

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>And update the Japanese highlights as well:</details></think>

---

Now let me update the Japanese highlights:

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to modify the Projects component to handle the Streamlit logo for the demo link. Since the user wants to use the Streamlit logo for the demo link, I need to update the Projects.tsx component to check for Streamlit apps and display the appropriate icon.

Let me update the Projects component to handle the Streamlit demo link with the proper logo.</details></think>

---

Now I need to update the Projects component to show the Streamlit logo for your demo link. Let me modify the demo link section:
