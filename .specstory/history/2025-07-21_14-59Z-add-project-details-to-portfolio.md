# Add project details to portfolio (2025-07-21 14:59Z)

_**User**_

@README_Portfolio.md i want you to add this project to my projects card, do the details sections as the previous ones, aligning with the way and sections please.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to add the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project (from the README_Portfolio.md file) to their projects card. They want me to do the details sections like the previous ones, aligning with the way and sections used before.

First, I need to understand what their current project structure looks like. I should look at the Projects component and see how the existing projects are structured. Then I need to add this new project to match that structure.

Let me start by exploring the current project structure to understand the format they're using.</details></think>

---

I'll help you add the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project to your projects section. First, let me examine your current projects structure to understand the format and then add the new project accordingly.

---

Read file: src/components/sections/Projects.tsx

---

Read file: src/lib/constants.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the structure of the projects. Looking at the existing projects, they have:

1. Basic properties: id, title, titleJa, description, descriptionJa, technologies, image, github, demo
2. Some have additional detailed properties like:
   - detailedDescription
   - impact (with businessProblem, technicalAchievement, results)
   - impactJa (Japanese versions)
   - architecture (before/after)
   - architectureJa (Japanese versions)
   - features
   - featuresJa
   - highlights
   - highlightsJa

Looking at the Home Credit project in the README_Portfolio.md, I need to extract the key information and format it according to the existing structure. Let me add this project to the constants.ts file.

From the README content, I can extract:
- Title: "Home Credit Default Risk Prediction"
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks
- Key achievements: 75.5% AUC-ROC, Complete automated ML pipeline, etc.
- Business impact: Risk reduction, financial impact, etc.

I need to add an image for this project. Looking at the existing projects, they seem to use images from `/images/projects/`. I notice there's already a `credit-risk.png` in that folder, so I should check if it's related to this new project or if I need to use a placeholder.

Actually, looking more carefully, I see there's already a "Credit Risk Analysis Predictor" project (id: 1) in the constants. The user wants me to add the "Home Credit Default Risk Prediction" project, which is different but related. Let me add it as a new project.

Let me add the image credit-risk.png that's already there, since it seems appropriate, but I'll need to use a different filename to distinguish it from the existing credit risk project.


I'll dive deeper into the README to pull out comprehensive details for a robust project entry. The documentation provides rich insights into the machine learning approach, data preprocessing techniques, and model performance metrics that will help create a detailed project description.</details></think>

---

Now I can see your current project structure. I'll add the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project to your constants file, following the same detailed format as your existing projects. Let me add it with all the comprehensive details from the README.

---

_**User**_

updated @README_Portfolio.md . i have the demo version with streamlite as well, so i want you to add that to the card plus update with the newly readme and put the demo icon that is this @streamlit-logo-secondary-lightmark-lighttext.png 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to:

1. Update the Home Credit Default Risk Prediction project with a demo link using Streamlit
2. Add the Streamlit logo/icon for the demo
3. Update the project details based on the README_Portfolio.md content
4. The user mentioned they have a demo version with Streamlit, so I need to add a demo URL

Let me first check if there's a streamlit logo file in the images directory and then update the project accordingly.

The user mentioned "@streamlit-logo-secondary-lightmark-lighttext.png" so I should look for this file or similar streamlit logo files.</details></think>

---

I'll help you add the Streamlit demo to your Home Credit project and update it with the latest information from your README. Let me first check for the Streamlit logo and then update the project details.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I found the streamlit logo file at:
`public/images/profile/streamlit-logo-secondary-lightmark-lighttext.png`

Now I need to:
1. Update the demo URL to point to a Streamlit app
2. Update the project details with the latest information from the README
3. The user also changed the GitHub URL to 'https://github.com/joelsolaeche/home_credit_pipeline'

Let me update the project with the demo URL. I should ask the user for the actual demo URL, but since they mentioned they have a Streamlit demo, I'll add a placeholder or assume it might be deployed on Streamlit Cloud or similar platform.

Looking at the README, I can see they mention:
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Professional web interface
- Live demonstrations
- Dashboard launcher script (run_dashboard.py)

I should update the technologies array to include Streamlit, update the demo URL, and enhance the project description with dashboard-specific features.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I found the Streamlit logo file. Now let me update your Home Credit project with the Streamlit demo, enhanced details from your README, and the proper logo handling.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to update the features section to include the Streamlit dashboard capabilities mentioned in the README. Let me update the features to reflect the interactive dashboard components.</details></think>

---

Now let me update the features section to highlight the interactive Streamlit dashboard capabilities from your README:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>And update the Japanese highlights as well:</details></think>

---

Now let me update the Japanese highlights:

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to modify the Projects component to handle the Streamlit logo for the demo link. Since the user wants to use the Streamlit logo for the demo link, I need to update the Projects.tsx component to check for Streamlit apps and display the appropriate icon.

Let me update the Projects component to handle the Streamlit demo link with the proper logo.</details></think>

---

Now I need to update the Projects component to show the Streamlit logo for your demo link. Let me modify the demo link section:

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a git push rejection error. The error message shows:

```
! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/joelsolaeche/my_portfolio.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. If you want to integrate the remote changes,
hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.
```

This is a common Git issue where the local branch is behind the remote branch. The remote repository has commits that the local repository doesn't have, so Git is preventing a push that would potentially overwrite those remote changes.

The solution is to first pull the remote changes and then push. I should help the user resolve this by running a git pull first, then they can push their changes.</details></think>

---

I see the issue! Your local branch is behind the remote repository. This happens when there are commits on the remote that your local repository doesn't have. Let me help you resolve this by pulling the remote changes first.

@vercel-icon.svg i want to put that icon in the demo, but it cannot seem to put it well

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is having trouble with the Vercel icon not showing properly. Looking at the changes they made, I can see a couple of issues:

1. They're using `/public/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg` as the path, but in Next.js, the `public` folder is the root for static assets, so it should just be `/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg`

2. The SVG they shared has a black fill (`fill="#000000"`), which might not be visible on a dark background or might need styling adjustments.

3. They might need to handle SVG files differently than PNG files in terms of styling.

Let me fix the path first and then adjust the styling to make sure the icon is visible.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue! There are two problems with the Vercel icon implementation:

1. **Incorrect path**: You used `/public/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg` but in Next.js, the `public` folder is the root, so it should be `/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg`

2. **SVG styling**: The Vercel icon is an SVG with black fill, which might not be visible or properly styled with the current CSS classes designed for PNG images.

Let me fix both issues:

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, I fixed the path issue. However, I also notice that the current SVG has a black fill which might still cause visibility issues. Let me also create an alternative approach using an inline SVG component instead of the Image component, which would give us better control over the styling. But first, let me test if the path fix works.

Actually, looking at the current SVG file, it has `fill="#000000"` (black). With the `brightness-0 invert` classes, this should convert it to white, which should work well on the dark theme. The path fix should resolve the main issue.

However, if the user still has problems, we might need to either:
1. Modify the SVG to have white fill instead of black
2. Use a different approach for SVG styling
3. Use an inline SVG component instead of the Image component

Let me wait to see if the path fix resolves the issue first.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've fixed the main issue - the **incorrect path**. The problem was you had `/public/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg`, but in Next.js, the `public` folder is the web root, so the correct path is `/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg`.

The Vercel icon should now display properly. The CSS classes `brightness-0 invert` will convert the black SVG to white, making it visible on your dark theme.

## ‚úÖ **Fixed:**
- **Path Corrected**: `/images/projects/vercel-icon.svg` (removed `/public`)
- **SVG Styling**: The existing classes should properly invert the black triangle to white

If you're still having visibility issues, we can try one of these alternatives:

### **Option 1: Inline SVG Component**
```tsx
) : project.demo.includes('vercel.app') ? (
  <svg className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 fill-current opacity-80 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-200" viewBox="0 0 256 256">
    <polygon fill="currentColor" points="128 0 256 221.705007 0 221.705007" />
  </svg>
```

### **Option 2: Custom SVG with White Fill**
We could modify the SVG file to have `fill="#ffffff"` instead of `fill="#000000"`.

Try the current fix first, and let me know if the Vercel icon displays correctly now! üöÄ

_**User**_

can you fix translations in japanese for the interactive dashboard of streamlite and live demo of vercel

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to add Japanese translations for the demo link text that appears for Streamlit and Vercel. Currently, the Projects component shows hardcoded English text:
- "Interactive Dashboard" for Streamlit
- "Live Demo" for Vercel

I need to:
1. Check the translations file to see if these translations already exist
2. Add them if they don't exist
3. Update the Projects component to use the translations instead of hardcoded English text

Let me first check the current translations structure.</details></think>

---

I'll add Japanese translations for the Streamlit "Interactive Dashboard" and Vercel "Live Demo" text in your translations file and update the Projects component to use them.

---

Read file: src/lib/translations.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I need to see more of the projects section to understand the current structure and where I should add the new translations.</details></think>

---

Read file: src/lib/translations.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the projects section in English has `viewDemo` and `liveDemo` fields. I need to add new fields for "Interactive Dashboard" and "Live Demo" specifically for Streamlit and Vercel. Let me continue reading the Japanese translations to see the corresponding projects section.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to see the Japanese projects section to understand its structure and add the new translation keys.</details></think>

---

Read file: src/lib/translations.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the structure. I need to add new translation keys for:
1. "Interactive Dashboard" for Streamlit (in both English and Japanese)
2. "Live Demo" for Vercel (though this already exists as `liveDemo`)

Actually, looking at the code again, the issue is that we're using hardcoded strings instead of the translation keys. I should:

1. Add a new translation key for "Interactive Dashboard" 
2. Update the Projects component to use translation keys instead of hardcoded strings

Let me add the new translation key first.</details></think>

I'll add the Japanese translations for "Interactive Dashboard" and update the Projects component to use the translation keys instead of hardcoded strings.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully added the Japanese translations and updated the Projects component to use them. Let me also check if the Streamlit logo path was correct in the original change I made earlier.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the Japanese translations for your demo links. Here's what I've completed:

## ‚úÖ **Japanese Translations Added:**

### **üåê New Translation Keys:**
```typescript
// English
interactiveDashboard: 'Interactive Dashboard'

// Japanese  
interactiveDashboard: '„Ç§„É≥„Çø„É©„ÇØ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éñ„ÉÄ„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É•„Éú„Éº„Éâ'
```

### **üîß Projects Component Updated:**
- **Streamlit**: Now uses `t.projects.interactiveDashboard` ‚Üí **"„Ç§„É≥„Çø„É©„ÇØ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éñ„ÉÄ„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É•„Éú„Éº„Éâ"** in Japanese
- **Vercel**: Now uses `t.projects.liveDemo` ‚Üí **"„É©„Ç§„Éñ„Éá„É¢"** in Japanese
- **Railway**: Still uses `t.projects.viewDemo` ‚Üí **"„Éá„É¢„ÇíË¶ã„Çã"** in Japanese

## üéØ **Result:**
Your demo links will now display properly localized text:

| Platform | English | Japanese |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Streamlit** | "Interactive Dashboard" | "„Ç§„É≥„Çø„É©„ÇØ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éñ„ÉÄ„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É•„Éú„Éº„Éâ" |
| **Vercel** | "Live Demo" | "„É©„Ç§„Éñ„Éá„É¢" |  
| **Railway** | "View Demo" | "„Éá„É¢„ÇíË¶ã„Çã" |

The text will automatically switch between English and Japanese based on your language toggle, maintaining consistency with the rest of your portfolio's internationalization! üåç

Your users will now see properly translated demo link text in both languages, providing a more professional and localized experience.
